  <p>This view of <strong>Jupiter’s turbulent <u>atmosphere</u></strong> from <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/deep-jet-streams-in-jupiter-s-atmosphere" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">NASA’s"</a> Juno spacecraft includes several of the planet’s southern jet streams. Using data from Juno’s instruments, scientists discovered that Jupiter’s powerful atmospheric jet streams extend far deeper than previously imagined. Evidence from Juno shows the jet streams and belts penetrate about 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometers) down into the planet.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">The storm known as the Great Red Spot is also visible on the horizon, nearly rotated out of view as Juno sped away from Jupiter at about 30 miles per second (48 kilometers per second), which is more than 100,000 mph (160,900 kilometers per hour). </p>
